## What is Pacifist?

Pacifist is a specialized utility for macOS that allows users to open and explore the contents of installer packages (.pkg), disk images (.dmg), and other archive formats without running the installer. It provides direct access to individual files, making it an essential tool for developers, system administrators, and power users who need to extract, inspect, or recover specific components from software installers.

The application supports a wide range of formats, including XAR archives, ZIP files, and Apple Disk Images. With Pacifist, you can view detailed information about each file inside a package, verify checksums, and even install individual items directly to your system. This is especially useful for repairing corrupted installations, recovering deleted files, or customizing software deployments.

Pacifist is fully compatible with all modern versions of macOS, including Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, and Big Sur. It runs natively on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, ensuring fast and reliable performance. The interface is clean and intuitive, allowing users to drag and drop packages for instant analysis.
